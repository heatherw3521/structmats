This folder is currently a sandbox where we are developing fast solvers for structured matrices.
Right now, the functionality is rather limited. This is primarily because we are 
in the process of developing more flexible hierarchical NLA routines and class structures.



For Toeplitz systems, we have square matrices with dimensions that are powers of 2. 
We use a modified variant of the hm-toolbox for the HSS structures, and currently 
this is rather limited. 


For Vandermonde NUDFT systems, we have a solver working for the overdetermined setting. 
Right now, the solver doesn't work for square or underdetermined matrices. This is 
under development.
