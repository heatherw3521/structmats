INVERSE NUDFT + TOEPLITZ SOLVER: 

Working examples in tests/test_toeplitz_solver (for toeplitz system), 
tests/test_INUDFT, tests/run_driverINUDFT, test_inudft_rect for Vandermonde (NUDFT) systems.

extras: extra functions for setting up Toeplitz/Cauchy/Vandermonde matrices, 
testing their compressibility properties.

itersolv: Alex B folder, sinc-interp iterative solver + drivers. Includes conversion 
for ADI-Vandermonde convention to NUFFT convention.  

modified_HMtoolbox_files2019: modification of the HMtoolbox from Massei, Robol, Kressner. Includes all ADI compression routines, 
constructor for HSS struc. object, HSS solvers. 

tests: all final tests for direct inversion methods + additional tests for properties, verification of bounds, comparisons.
